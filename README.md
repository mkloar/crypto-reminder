## Setup

I setup Android Studio project with a help of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSIhiZ5jRB0) and successfully managed to deploy the app on the android device. Haven't really tried with an iOS device yet.

[This youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ) might be a good starting point to a Flutter world.
